        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This classic appetizer is not only delicious; it also makes a lovely centerpiece
            for a cheese board. Use scraps from the dough to make small decorations for the 
            top and sides.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup warm milk(105&#176F-110&#176F)</li>
            <li>2 3/4 cups sugar, divided</li>
            <li>1 3/4 teaspoons (1 envelope) active dry yeast</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, divided</li>
            <li>3/4 cup unsalted butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon plus 1 pinch kosher salt, divided</li>
            <li>4-6 cups bread flour</li>
            <li>1 (2-pound) wheel Brie cheese</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon water</li>
        </ul>
            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    In a large bowl, combine milk, 1 cup sugar,
                    and yeast. Stir to dissolve and let stand until
                    foamy, about 10 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add 3 eggs, butter, remaining 1 3/4 cups sugar, 
                    and 1 teaspoon salt: stir to combine. Add enough 
                    bread flour to create a firm dough. Turn dough 
                    out onto a floured work surface and knead, adding 
                    more flour only as necessary to avoid stickiness, 
                    until dough becomes smooth and elastic, 8-10 minutes. 
                    Return dough to bowl, dust the top lightly with flour, 
                    and cover with a damp cloth or plastic wrap. Let rise 
                    at room temperature until doubled in volume, 2-3 hours. 
                    Punch dough down, fold in half, and let rise again until 
                    doubled, about 45 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Preheat oven to 425&#176F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Turn risen dough onto floured surface and with a rolling 
                    pin, roll out into a circle 3"-4" wider than the wheel of 
                    Brie. Place Brie into center of circle, and fold edges over 
                    to completely conceal cheese. Place on prepared baking sheet 
                    seam-side down.
                </li>
                <li>
                    In a small bowl, whisk together remaining egg and pinch salt 
                    with water. Brush mixture across surface of dough. Bake 15 
                    minutes, then reduce heat to 375&#176F and continue baking 
                    until puffed and golden, 30-35 minutes. Remove to a rack and 
                    cool down 10 minutes before serving.
